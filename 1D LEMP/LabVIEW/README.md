# 1D LEMP code in LabVIEW
This repo holds work done to get 1D LEMP working on real-time embedded systems using LabVIEW

## Theory
* Full LabVIEW implementation of LEMP
* Runs on a Windows machine using data stored in CSV files


## Online
* Take data from a cDAQ system and perform LEMP online.
* Comes in through a analog voltage data that is intended to replicate DROPBEAR data

## Embedded
* LabVIEW system running on embedded controller
* Could be a PXI or a cRIO


## Real-time
* LabVIEW code running on Linux Real-time
* Should be able to run on cRIO or PXI in real-time.
